Explanation: This code is a very simple code that still has some use, which is to sort as many integers as the user wants. The sorting algorithm uses "selection sort", which is a method I learned from my high school. For the program to work, the end of the element needs to be a non-integer so that it can separate itself from the set and properly function.
